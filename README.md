# GoeODM

GoeODM (Göttingen Open Digital Museum ) is a project dedicated to capturing and maintaining 3D models of monuments and public art in the city spaces of Göttingen using photogrammetry.

## Project Goals
The primary aim of this project is to document and preserve 3D models of Göttingen's cultural and artistic heritage. By leveraging modern photogrammetry techniques, we hope to make high-quality 3D models of monuments and public art widely accessible.

## Explore the Models
You can browse the 3D models on Sketchfab or download them here if you require more precise formats.

## How We Work
There is no strict standard but most of the models so far made this way:
- **Photo Capture**: All photos are captured using an iPhone.
- **Processing**: The images are processed using Apple's Object Capture API (Reality Composer Pro).

## How to Contribute
Feel free to contribute to this project in any way you can. Whether it's capturing new models, improving existing ones, or sharing feedback, your help is greatly appreciated!
